Design Assignment 3B: 
The goal of the assignment is to modify the above codes to do the following: 
 
1. Write a C AVR program that will monitor the LM34/35 connected to an Analog pin (PC5 or PC0) to display the temperature in Centigrade (C) and Fahrenheit (F) on the serial terminal every 0.5 sec. 
Use a timer with interrupt for the 0.1 sec delay and use a counter variable to implement the 0.5 sec delay. 
Use a FTDI chip for serial to USB conversion and display the values in the terminal. 

2. Use the ATMEL Studio Data Visualizer or any Charting program to display the values in time.
