Midterm1: Motor Speed Interface    
 
Q: Write, simulate, and demonstrate using Atmel Studio 7 a C code for the AVR ATMEGA328p microcontroller that performs 
the following functions: 
 
Youâ€™ll use the ADC, and PWM/CCP Module of the ATmega328/p to set and determine the speed of the DC Motor.  
1. Use the motor driver, program the ATMega to drive the geared DC motor in CW and CCW direction for a given PWM. 
2. Using the Potentiometer connected to ADC0, translate the ADC value to PWM value/ speed of the motor. Verify the operation. 
3. Using the CCP capture pin of PWM1, in mode 1x and 2x determine the speed of the DC Motor for a set ADC Pot value/position.  
4. Using CCP capture and interrupt (mode 4x), determine the speed of the DC Motor for a set ADC Pot value/position.
