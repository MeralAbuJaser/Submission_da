Design Assignment 6 
The goal of the assignment is to 
 
1. Interface the provided MPU-6050 6-DOF IMU Sensor to the ATmega328p using the I2C interface.
Using the earlier developed code for UART, display the accelerometer and gyro data to the UART Terminal.  
Visualizing the accelerometer and gyro values using the serial plotter.  

2. Apply complementary filtering* on the sensor data, calculate the smooth/filtered pitch and roll angles and display 
the filtered values in the graph.
