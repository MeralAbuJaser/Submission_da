Midterm1: UART Interface      Due Date: See Website 

 

Q: Write, simulate, and demonstrate using Atmel Studio 7 a C code 

for the AVR ATMEGA328p microcontroller that performs the following functions: 

 

1. Program the UART Module to interact with the ATmega328/p: 

2. On transmitting the following keys from the host terminal, the following actions will be performed: 

1. On-reboot or ‘h’ key – help screen (list all keys and functionalities) 

2. ‘t’ display temperature in C of LM34/35 on terminal, ‘T’ - display temperature in F of LM34/35 on terminal.

3. ‘o’ turns ON LED at PB5, ‘O’ turns OFF the LED at PB5. 

4. ‘s’ sends a string to the terminal. 

5. ‘i’ sends an integer to the terminal. Use the integer as a delay in seconds to blink the LED PB2.
