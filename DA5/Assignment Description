CpE301 - Design Assignment 5     
 
Design Assignment 5 The goal of the assignment is to develop the  following: 
 
1. Using the Multi-function shield, using a custom serial transfer protocol display the temperature 
sensor value (int only) of LM34/35 on to the seven-segment display.  

2. Using the Multi-function shield, using the SPI protocol display the temperature sensor value (int only) 
of LM34/35 on to the seven-segment display.  3. Using one-wire interface display the temperature sensor 
for DS18B20 on the UART terminal.
