Design Assignment 4B: 

The goal of the assignment is to develop the following: 

 

1. Write an AVR C program to control the speed of the Stepper Motor using a potentiometer connected to PC0. 

Use a timer in CTC mode to control the delay. 

2. Write an AVR C program to control the position of the Servo Motor using a potentiometer connected to PC0. 

When pot value is 0 the servo is at position 0 deg. and when pot value is max (approx. 5V) the servo is at position 180 deg.
